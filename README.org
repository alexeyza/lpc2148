* Introduction
  The final project of
  [[http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/Courses/Embedded/announcement.html]["Embedded Systems"]]
  course at Tel-Aviv unversity was to create
  virtual ethernet interface that can be used to control LPC2148 board, which we studied
  during the course.
  The idea is to program the board in such way that when connecting it through USB to a normal
  linux machine, a network device will be detected. This will allow the user to connect
  to the device through standard /telnet/ connection and use a command line menu to control the board. 
* High level design
  The system can be divided to 3 main parts:
** Usb Engine
   This part is responsible for initialization and the logic of the USB ethernet device.
   It's responsibilities are to answer the standard USB requests, identify itself as an ethernet
   USB device and interact with the host by sending and receiving ethernet frames. 
** Network Engine
   The responsibility of this part is to build the network stack on top of the base services
   provided by the USB engine and to allow sending and receiving of data payloads from the
   host (linux) machine to the application part.
** Application
   This is the logic which translates data, sent through the network connection, to LPC2148
   control commands. This allows user interaction with the board through command line interface (CLI). 
* Implementation
  We first started to implement the "USB Engine" part. We used the demo code from
  [[http://courses.cs.tau.ac.il/embedded/exercises/usb.pdf][exercise 8]] to
  implement the standard usb requests, which are sent by the host during the USB enumeration process. 

  Then we needed to make the host machine to identify the device as an ethernet device.
  Googling revealed us that several communication protocols exist to interact with USB network device.
  In linux, the CDC protocol allows this communication and in windows exists a similar protocol
  called RNDIS. Naturally we decided to focus on linux hosts and after some reading we found out
  that light cdc implementation exists for network devices with minimal set of features
  called cdc_subset. 

  After reading the linux sources
  ([[http://lxr.linux.no/linux+*/drivers/net/usb/cdc_subset.c][drivers/net/usb/cdc_subset.c]])
  we came up with idea to take the
  identity of an existing device so that the linux cdc_subset kernel driver will be chosen to work
  with our device. The idea was successful and after putting a vendor and a product id of
  "Belkin ethernet device" into our usb descriptor, the device was successfully detected as an
  ethernet device. New network interface was created by the os and we started receiving ethernet
  frames through the USB bulk endpoint which we defined in the usb descriptor. 

  Next step was to write a simple code to assemble an ethernet frame from 64 bytes USB frames
  which we got from the host. We used a ring of 8 buffers to allow queuing up to 8 ethernet
  frames received from the host. In addition we used one buffer to allow sending of ethernet
  frame to the host. 

  Since we needed to implement the network stack (TCP/IP) to get a true network connection, we used
  [[http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page][uip]] which is a light TCP/IP stack targeted
  for the embedded development. We hooked the the UIP implementation with our USB driver which
  was capable of sending and receiving ethernet frames and as a result we had the ability to open
  sockets, send/receive data through it and had the ability to respond to ICMP requests
  and ARP requests. 

  Here we encountered 2 small problems. Our working environment was ubuntu 9.10 live cd.
  The default behavior of the network stack on ubuntu is to work with ipv6 which was not completely
  supported by the uip implementation. So we disabled it and configured the interface to use ipv4.
  Another problem was the limitation of the uip implementation to handle ip headers of constant size
  (without the variable options part). So we disabled the network-manager daemon of ubuntu which
  was sending automatically "problematic" ip packets. Now the implementation worked perfectly
  and we moved to the implementation of the application. 

  We used the telnetd application distributed with the uip to implement a command line interface
  which controls the board. The user connects to the USB device by first configuring the network
  interface with ifconfig and then running telnet to the specific ip. Then the user gets a prompt
  and can run commands which invoke different hardware drivers, some of which were implemented
  during the exercises in the course. The commands are: 
  - lcd <msg> - print the message to the lcd screen
  - matrix <msg> - display the message char by char on the leds matrix
  - rgb <color> - change the rgb led to the specified color
  - temperature - print the temperature returned by the board sensor
  - motor - rotate the step motor for several seconds
  - help, ? - display help menu
  - exit - disconnect
* Step by step demonstration
  We tested our gadget on pc running ubuntu 9.10.
  + After connecting usb cable between the board and the test pc, the usb ethernet adapted
    would be detected by the linux kernel and the cdc_subset kernel module would be loaded to interact
    with the device
    [[file:images/device_connect.jpg][file:images/device_connect.jpg]]

  + Now we can configure the new interface and give it ip address
    [[file:images/ifconfig.jpg][file:images/ifconfig.jpg]]

  + Since we compiled the uip library without ipv6 support we will disable it in the linux
    machine. We will also stop the network manager which sends ip packets with with 'options' part that
    is not supported by the uip stack. This actions are specific for ubuntu 9.10 and won't be needed
    for older releases.
  + now we can ping our virtual ethernet interface and connect to it
    [[file:images/login.jpg][file:images/login.jpg]]
  + We can use the various commands to interact with the LPC2148 periphery:
    - print message to LCD screen
    - display message on the led matrix
    - measure the temperature
    - rotate the step motor
    - set the color of the RGB led
  + We also provide nice GUI program which configures the interface automatically and provides
    all options which can be accessed through the command line.
    The gui program is written in python and requires python-tk package to be installed
    (apt-get install python-tk).
